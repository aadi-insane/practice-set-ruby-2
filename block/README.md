# ðŸ’Ž Ruby Practice: Blocks, Procs, and Lambdas (Beginner Level)

This document contains 15 beginner-friendly practice exercises to help you understand and use **blocks**, **procs**, and **lambdas** in Ruby.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Blocks

### 1. Print each element using a block

Use a block to print each number in the array `[1, 2, 3]`.

---

### 2. Use a `do...end` block to print strings

Print a message like "I like fruit" for each fruit in the array `['apple', 'banana']` using a `do...end` block.

---

### 3. Sum numbers with `each` and a block

Use a block with `.each` to calculate the sum of numbers in the array `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.

---

### 4. Custom method that takes a block

Write a method `greet` that prints a greeting, then yields to a block if given, and then prints a goodbye.

---

### 5. Yield multiple times

Define a method that yields to a block three times.

---

## ðŸ§± Procs

### 6. Create and call a proc

Create a proc that prints a message and call it.

---

### 7. Proc that takes parameters

Create a proc that takes a name and prints a greeting using that name.

---

### 8. Pass a proc to a method

Write a method that accepts a proc and calls it.

---

### 9. Store a block as a proc with `&block`

Write a method that captures a block as a proc using `&block` and then calls it.

---

### 10. Use a proc with `map`

Create a proc that squares a number and use it with `map` on an array.

---

## ðŸ”— Lambdas

### 11. Create and call a lambda

Create a lambda that prints a message and call it.

---

### 12. Lambda with parameters

Write a lambda that adds two numbers and call it.

---

### 13. Use lambda in a method

Write a method that takes a lambda as an argument and executes it.

---

### 14. Lambda with `map`

Create a lambda that doubles a number and use it with `map` on an array.

---

### 15. Difference between proc and lambda in arity

Demonstrate the difference in how procs and lambdas handle arguments (arity).
